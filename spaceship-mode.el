;;; General terminological note: spaceship-mode is concerned with adjusting the
;;; width of only spaces and tabs which occur before a printing character (not
;;; space or tab) on a line.  To avoid any possible ambiguity, we do not use the
;;; word “indentation” (which might refer only to tabs, not to alignment spaces)
;;; and instead speak of “leading-space spaces” or “leading-space tabs”, where
;;; “leading-space” means the characters on a line before the first printing
;;; char.  It is ambiguous whether Unicode space characters other than space and
;;; (horizontal) tab should be considered part of the leading space or not, but
;;; in the code we assume it is only spaces and tabs, because there is no
;;; possible purpose that including other space characters could serve.  Thus
;;; spaceship-mode treats other space characters as printing characters.

;;; Code:

(defcustom spaceship-tab-pixel-width 20
  "‘spaceship-mode’ will adjust all leading-space tabs to have this width."
  :type 'int :group 'spaceship)

(defcustom spaceship-auto-preserve nil
  "Whether ‘spaceship-mode’ should attempt to preserve the alignment of blocks
of code or text aligned to a line when that line is edited before the point of
alignment."
  :type 'boolean :group 'spaceship)

(define-minor-mode spaceship-mode
  "Automatically adjust width of space characters in certain places to allow
better text alignment with a variable-width font.

More precisely, any space character on a line with no printing characters before
it will be matched up with a corresponding character on the previous line, if
there is one.  That character may itself be a width-adjusted space, meaning the
width ultimately comes from some other kind of character higher up.

As an exception, a space will not be matched with a tab, but a tab may be.  (A
tab does not match anything else.)  Once a mismatch occurs, no further
adjustments will happen on this line.

Due to technical limitations, this mode does not try to detect situations where
the font has changed but the text hasn't, which will mess up the alignment.  You
can run ‘spaceship-do-buffer’ to fix it."
