;;; Commentary:

;;; General terminological note: elastindent-mode is concerned with
;;; adjusting the width of only spaces and tabs which occur before a
;;; printing character (not space or tab) on a line.  We use the word
;;; “indentation” to refer to these tabs or spaces.  It is ambiguous
;;; whether Unicode space characters other than space and (horizontal)
;;; tab should be considered part of the leading space or not, but in
;;; the code we assume it is only spaces and tabs.  Thus
;;; elastindent-mode treats other space characters as printing
;;; characters.
;;; The support for tabs is currently limited.  Tabs can only be first
;;; in the indentation (they cannot follows spaces).  Editting code
;;; with tabs isn't fully supported either.

;;; Code:

Adjust the width of indentation characters to align the indented
code to the correct position.  The correct position is defined as
the same relative position to the previous line as it were if a
fixed-pitch face was used.

More precisely, any space character on a line with no printing
characters before it will be matched up with a corresponding
character on the previous line, if there is one.  That character
may itself be a width-adjusted space, meaning the width
ultimately comes from some other kind of character higher up.

Due to technical limitations, this mode does not try to detect
situations where the font has changed but the text hasn't, which
will mess up the alignment.  You can run

indentation level is less than START-COL and starts after
CHANGE-END.

Thus a large value of START-COL means that little work needs to
be done by this function.  This optimisation is important,
because otherwise one needs to find a line with zero indentation,
which can be much further down the file.

If a change spans several lines, then START-COL is ignored, and
changes are propagated until indentation level reaches 0.
